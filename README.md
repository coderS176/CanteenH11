# Night Canteen H11  

**A streamlined solution for late-night hunger pangs.**  

---

## Problem Statement  

As a student who stays up late, I often get hungry at night and head to the night canteen. However, long wait times, crowded queues, and inefficient processes frustrated the experience. This wasnâ€™t just my problem; many students faced the same issue every night.  

Recognizing this, I envisioned a digital solution to make the night canteen experience smoother and more efficient.

## Our Solution  

**Night Canteen H11** was designed to streamline the ordering process for hostel canteens, providing a seamless experience for both students and canteen operators.  

### Key Features  

- **Real-Time Order Tracking:**  
  Students can track the status of their orders in real-time, knowing exactly when to head to the canteen.  

- **Preparation Time Estimation:**  
  An algorithm estimates preparation times, allowing users to plan their pickups efficiently.  

- **Separate Applications:**  
  - **Student App:** Simplifies the ordering process and provides notifications about the order status.  
  - **Canteen Owner App:** Manages incoming orders, tracks preparation times, and updates order status.  

- **Reduced Waiting Time:**  
  Students save 30-40 minutes daily by avoiding queues and unnecessary waiting.
